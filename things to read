Notes 
-> A class component must include render(), and the return can only return one parent element.
-> if the return is contained to one line, it does not need parentheses.
-> We'll need the constructor() to use this, and to receive the props of the parent.
-> Lifecycle is the order in which methods are called in React. Mounting refers to an item being inserted into the DOM.
